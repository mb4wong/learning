This is my learning repository. I'm super excited about learning how to code and I've got the following few projects to get me going:

- Calculator: Create a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- To-Do List: Build a command-line to-do list manager where you can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them.
- Guess the Number Game: Create a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it within a certain number of attempts.
- Word Counter: Develop a program that reads a text file and counts the number of words, characters, and lines in it.
- Basic Weather App: Build a simple command-line weather application that fetches and displays current weather data for a user-specified location using an API.
- Hangman Game: Implement a text-based version of the classic Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word.
- Simple Alarm Clock: Build a program that allows users to set alarms with a specific time and a message, and it notifies them when the alarm time is reached.
- File Organizer: Create a script that organizes files in a specified directory by categorizing them into subfolders based on file types (e.g., images, documents, music).
- Basic Web Scraper: Write a script that scrapes information from a website of your choice and extracts specific data, such as headlines, quotes, or product prices.
- Currency Converter: Develop a program that converts currency from one currency to another, utilizing real-time exchange rate data from a reliable source via an API.
